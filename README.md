# Image Map (work in progress)

A small pet project to allow me (or you) to draw bounding boxes on an image and store the coordinates for later user in ML/AI applications.

Importing an image library (a project) into a database will allow you to quickly step thru all images. Supports multiple classes.

## Getting Started

Still working thru the process...

### Prerequisites

* Database server (only tested on MySQL)
* Web server (developed with nginx)
* PHP (developed with version 7 installed)

### Installing

Still working on this...

Will need to copy config-default.php to config.php before running

```

```
